# Sales-Trends-Analysis

Business Use Case

In a competitive retail environment, understanding sales performance is crucial for making
informed business decisions. Retail managers need insights into which products are
performing well, the average sales volume, and variations across different categories to
optimize inventory and marketing strategies.

Problem Statement

The retail store has observed fluctuating sales numbers across various product categories.
The management wants to analyze the sales data to:

1. Identify trends and patterns in sales.

2. Determine if the average sales volume significantly differs from a target value (e.g.,
20 units).

3. Provide insights into sales performance across different product categories.

Objectives

1. Perform descriptive statistics to summarize sales data.

2. Conduct inferential statistics to test hypotheses regarding average sales.

3. Visualize sales performance for better decision-making.

Dataset

We will create a synthetic dataset that simulates sales data for 20 products across four

Data Features

Â· product_id: Unique identifier for each product.

. product_name: Name of the product.

. category: Category to which the product belongs.

. units_sold: Number of units sold (generated using a Poisson distribution).
sale_date: Date of the sale.

Project Documentation:

Descriptive Statistics

1. Mean: The average number of units sold.

2. Median: The middle value in the distribution of units sold.

3. Mode: The most frequently sold quantity.

4. Variance and Standard Deviation: Measures of how much the units sold vary from
the mean.

5. Category Statistics: Total and average sales per product category.

Inferential Statistics

1. Confidence Interval: Provides a range that likely contains the population mean of
units sold, giving insight into sales consistency.

2. Hypothesis Testing (t-test): Tests whether the average sales volume significantly
differs from the target value of 20 units.

Visualizations

1. Histogram: Shows the distribution of units sold, highlighting the mean, median, and
mode.

2. Boxplot: Displays the spread and outliers of units sold across different categories.
3. Bar Plot: Summarizes total sales by category for quick comparisons.
